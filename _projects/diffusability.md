short_description: >-
  Latent diffusion models are the state-of-the-art for image and video generation, but their latent spaces often contain unwanted high-frequency components that degrade quality. Our work introduces scale equivariance, a simple regularization strategy that aligns latent and RGB spaces across frequencies. With minimal fine-tuning, this approach delivers significant improvements—reducing FID by 19% on ImageNet-1K and FVD by over 44% on Kinetics-700—making generative models more efficient and higher quality.

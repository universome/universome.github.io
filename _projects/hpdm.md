short_description: >-
    The two dominant diffusion paradigms are latent diffusion and cascaded diffusion. We propose a novel patch-based diffusion model that allows end-to-end training for high resolutions. The model is structured hierarchically and trained to denoise random patches of various scales in a coarse-to-fine manner. It achieves state-of-the-art results on class-conditional UCF-101 \(64 \times 256^2\) generation and promising scaling performance as a foundational \(64 \times 288\times 512\) text-to-video model.

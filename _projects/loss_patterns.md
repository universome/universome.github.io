short_description: >-
    Using <i>mode connectivity</i> ideas, we searched loss landscapes of different neural networks for different visual patterns. Due to the extreme overparametrization, it turned out that any pattern can be found inside the surface. This indicates that the loss landscapes of deep models are very complex and contain many irregularities.

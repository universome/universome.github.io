    While the existing interpolation techniques (nearest neighbour, bilinear, Lanczos, Hamming, etc.) assume that the known points positions construct a uniform grid, it is not always the case. Moreover one would like to backpropagate through these points positions. In this project, I implemented a CUDA kernel for points interpolation on a non-uniform grid based on the Gaussian Mixture Model.
